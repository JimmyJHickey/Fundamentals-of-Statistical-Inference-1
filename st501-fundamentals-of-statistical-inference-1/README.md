# Fundamentals-of-Statistical-Inference-1
My scripts for Fundamentals of Statistical Inference 1.

Our final project can be found [here](https://github.com/JimmyJHickey/Sample-Distributions-Project). I worked on it with [Shaleni Kovach](https://github.com/Shaleni), [Meredith Saunders](https://github.com/mhsaunders), and [Stephanie Stewart](https://github.com/snstewart1994).
